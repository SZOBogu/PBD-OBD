# PBD-OBD
Tasks made for Basics of Databases and Object Databases on Cracow Univerity of Technology. Scheme of the database is in scheme.pdf. Originally tasks were made in Oracle's SQL. The scripts for schema creation and inserting data are provided, but for PostgreSQL.

There are quite a few gaps. I didn't save all the progress I made during classes.
